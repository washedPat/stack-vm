# Stack VM

This is a basic stack based VM. It can only do math operations and can only store integers.
I made this just a fun exercise but I found interesting none the less.

# Usage
1. clone this repo
2. go get any deps
3. run `go run main.go -path="./demo.vm`

# Assembly Language
```
PUSH <integer>
POP
ADD
SUB
DIV
MUL
MOD
```
